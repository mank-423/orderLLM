## Idea 💡
The idea came while I was doing GenerativeAI course from DeepLearningAI by AndrewYNg.
He stated that every job, is a mix of certain tasks that we need to perform, and generative AI could be a game-changer as it can automate the tasks, to increase efficiency of the job. Taking up the full job roles is still long-way to go but automation of tasks is possible.
He also mentioned a certain project idea which actually got me thinking about how to take up on this challenge, and thus, I have developed Order LLM v1.

## The basic working idea

## Core Concept 🤔

The fundamental idea behind Order LLM revolves around simplifying the order-taking process through an intelligent chatbot. Here's how it works:

- **Automated Order Taking:**
  Order LLM provides a chatbot that automates the entire order-taking job. Consumers can comfortably sit back and place their orders through a natural and interactive conversation with the bot.

- **Menu and Daily Offers:**
  The chatbot is fed with an extensive menu and daily offers, ensuring users have access to the latest and most enticing options. Whether it's a favorite dish or a special deal, the bot guides users through the available choices.

- **Automated Payment Options:**
  Upon reaching the end of the order process, Order LLM seamlessly transitions into the payment phase. The chatbot automatically provides payment options to users, streamlining the entire transaction without the need for manual intervention.

This core concept aims to enhance the user experience by offering a convenient and automated ordering system, making the entire process efficient and enjoyable.
